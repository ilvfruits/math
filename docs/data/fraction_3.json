    "question": "A collection of coins has 3 times as many quarters as dimes. The total value is $4.40. How many quarters are there?",
    "answer": "12",
    "explanation": "Let dimes = d, quarters = 3d. Value: 0.10d + 0.25(3d)=4.40 → 0.10d+0.75d=0.85d=4.40 → d=4.40/0.85≈5.176. This doesn't give whole coins. Alternative: 4 dimes ($0.40) and 16 quarters ($4.00) gives $4.40, but ratio is 4:1. Or 8 dimes ($0.80) and 12 quarters ($3.00) gives $3.80. Actually 12 quarters is $3.00, need $1.40 more from dimes, which is 14 dimes. Total: 14 dimes, 12 quarters, ratio ≈ 0.86:1, not 3:1. Let's find integer solution: 0.10d + 0.25(3d)=0.85d=4.40 → d=4.40/0.85=5.176... Multiply by 3: 5.176×3=15.529 quarters. Not integer. Closest integer: 5 dimes ($0.50) + 15 quarters ($3.75)=$4.25, or 6 dimes ($0.60)+18 quarters ($4.50)=$5.10. No exact solution with 3:1 ratio."
